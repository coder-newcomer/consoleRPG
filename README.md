It's focused as casual RPG game on a web. What you need is just playing it like clicking button, managing item, creating, mining, foraging, fight, waiting, gacha, and/or do anything you can do inside the game.

This game inspired from a [Whatsapp Bot](# "Source Needed!") RPG game and the original RPG game element. But because of limitations of my devices that cannot use any of game engine and my acknowledge, i try to bring it on web instead.
