# ❓What is this?
If someone go somewhere and stop by here (it's you!), you may notice that this folder only have 2 file (draft.txt and this readme file). So what is this place for? If you asking me.

This is – as same as the folder name – is a draft *place* to devote all the thoughts and concepts from the developer (me) to later be applied to the game, nothing else but this.

If you want, you can take a look at the concept map and how the project will look like in the future. It might look messy.
